## Copying and modifying bundled recipes
A good workflow is:
1) Inspect:
```bash
openclaw recipes show development-team > /tmp/development-team.md
```

2) Copy into your workspace recipes folder:
```bash
cp /tmp/development-team.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/recipes/my-dev-team.md
```

3) Edit the new recipe file and scaffold it.
